# Pre-Compiled Binaries for your convenience

Please enjoy. We will be posting "board testing" and "demo" binaries to this directory. Each directory will have a Readme.md which describes each firmwares purpose and features.

## Flashing new firmware to your badge
No special cables or software is required to flash pre-built images! :D

1. Connect the device to your computer. (linux, mac, osx, etc)
2. Hold down the second button ( AKA 'B', or bootloader) from the left, and press the reset button (use a paper-clip, etc)
  * Continue to hold down the (bootloader) button while you release the reset button.
  * The device should now present itself as a Mass Storage Device
3. Delete the firmware.bin file that is currently on the device.
4. Copy your new firmware image to the device.
5. Press and release the reset button once the file has finished copying.
6. ???
7. Profit.

## Code Requests
If you have a feature request or would like your name displayed or something specific, please contact us through github and we'll see what we can do. Code updates should continue for the next several months or longer.
